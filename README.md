# Call Agents

Want to build an AI voice/phone call agent? Here's a collection of different agents to get you started.

## Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
Star and clone this repo to get started.

### Step 2: Choose Your Agent
Decide which phone agent you want to use and navigate to its folder:

```bash
cd phone_agent_you_want_to_use
```

### Step 3: Set Up Virtual Environment
Create an isolated Python environment for your agent:

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

### Step 4: Install Requirements
Install the required packages for your chosen agent:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 5: Configure Your Agent
Fill out the `.env` file with the necessary configuration details for your agent. The code should provide clear instructions on what's needed.

### Step 6: Run Your Agent

Instructions for running each agent is in the README.md file in each agent's folder. The stuff should be pretty self explanatory, but if you have any questions, feel free to open an issue or contact me by twitter DMs @kylejeong21.
