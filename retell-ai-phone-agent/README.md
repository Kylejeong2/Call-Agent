# Retell AI Phone Agent

This is a simple example of a Retell AI Phone Agent that uses the Retell API to create an agent, purchase a phone number, and connect the agent to the phone number.

This was by far the easiest to setup and the best. That's what they're known for I guess. 
Less customizable than the pipecat stuff but definitely what you want to use for infra if you're starting out.
