# Retell AI Phone Agent

This is a simple example of a Retell AI Phone Agent that uses the Retell API to create an agent, purchase a phone number, and connect the agent to the phone number.

This was by far the easiest to setup but a little slower than the pipecat twilio-chatbot. The pipecat stuff would be amazing if someone could figure out how to get the interruptions to work.
Less customizable than the pipecat stuff but definitely what you want to use for infra if you're starting out. 

## How to use

Read through the comments in the code line by line and after you should just be able to figure it all out and run it. Retell is pretty straight forward and easy to use.
